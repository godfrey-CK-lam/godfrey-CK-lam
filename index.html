            <h2>About Me </h2>
            <p> I am a 3rd year student at Heriot-Watt University currently undertaking a Bachelor's degree in
                Computer Science (Cyber Security). I am interested in Cyber Security, Software engineering, and scripting with Python and Bash</p>

            <h2>My Stuff</h2>

            <h3> University </h3>
            <p> Here's some stuff I've done as part of University assignments, so unfortunately, I cannot show my exact
                code or the specifications I followed </p>

            <h3> A game of Hangman implemented in Java.</h3>
            <p> Used AWT Swing, and layouts to create a simple user-friendly GUI.</p>
            <p> Reads in a list of words from an external file, then creates the user interface itself, which
                consisted of a button grid, a word grid, and health bar.</p>
            <p> Using the concepts of coupling and cohesion, the game logic and the GUI were kept seperate, improving maintainability.</p>
            <p> A valuable introduction to event-driven programming, and reinforced OOP principles and developing GUIs. </p>

            <h3>An image processor written in C</h3>
            <p> Developed an image processor that applies a rotated image on top of itself, and color normalizes it, writing the processed image to a new file on disk </p>
            <p> Used file reading to read/write data, dynamic allocation to handle large images, and indexing logic to manipulate the image itself </p>
            <p> Understanding how memory is allocated and the consequences of poor management result in cleaner and more efficient code.</p>
            <p> Provided hands on experience with manual memory management and pointer manipulation</p>

            <h3> Personal </h3>
            <p> These are some projects I've done outside of University to expand my skillset beyond what I have learnt at University, and to solve small, but real problems with software</p>
            <h3> GateCrasher - A Python tool to display recent kill activity using the ESI API </h3>
            <p> The ESI (Eve Swagger interface) was used to retrieve JSON information about systems and calculate the route.</p>
            <p> This information was then parsed, and then structured into Python data types, before displayed in the CLI.</p>
            <p> Programming principles such as cohesion and coupling are followed, ensuring the logic, and CLI are kept seperate, improving maintainability.</p>
